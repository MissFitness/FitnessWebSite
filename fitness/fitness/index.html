			<h2>USEFUL</h2>
			<h2><img src="assets/img/eat.png"> Several foods we should eat every day:</h2>

			<div class="col-lg-5 feature">

				<h2><img src="assets/img/proteins.png"> Pure proteins</h2>

				<p>They help speed up your metabolism and encourage your body to burn more bad fat. Turkey, chicken breasts, pork or beef fillet provide you with muscle-building proteins without contributing to the accumulation of unwanted fat. Plug the meat and eggs into the menu, but do not overdo it.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="col-lg-5 feature">

				<h2><img src="assets/img/brocoli.png"> "Winter" vegetables</h2>

				<p>They are low in calories and high in fiber and essential nutrients. Carifiol, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts and beans are part of the group of cruciferous vegetables. Studies have shown that these vegetables can help prevent cancer by reducing oxidative stress and stimulating enzymes in the body that fight carcinogenic substances.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="col-lg-5 feature">

				<h2><img src="assets/img/Berry.png"> Fruits</h2>

				<p>These are very important when it comes to eating a balanced diet. Blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, etc. are an incredibly powerful source of antioxidants that help fight free radicals, slow down aging and reduce the risk of cancer. Fruits are always healthy and refreshing snacks and are especially good choices when you want something sweet, counsel nutritionists.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="col-lg-5 feature">

				<h2><img src="assets/img/bananas.png"> Bananas</h2>

				<p>Bananas are one of the easiest foods you need to include regularly in your diet because they are very versatile and comfortable. Eat a fruit before a sport or while you run for work. Studies have shown that bananas have a high potassium content that can reduce the risk of high blood pressure and stroke.</p>

						<p>People with large muscles and good bodies are not demigods or gods in human form. They are normal people. And they also love chocolate and pizza. Like you. With a tiny difference - <b>they know that their health and their good looks depend only on themselves.</b> And they work hard to achieve it. They do not spend all their time in the gym, but devote a certain amount of it to training. And they do it constantly.</p>

						<h2>Train with partner</h2>

						<p>The benefits of partner training are many, but it is important to note that not everyone is suitable for one. When choosing a fitness partner, find someone who shares your fitness goals in the long run - this will ensure that you and your two are always committed and motivated for a good workout. By common goals, we do not mean either of you want to lose weight, or both to face a rise in muscle mass but just someone who really wants to train and is serious in their intentions - if that is not the case, you risk not getting the emotional support and motivation you seek.</p>
